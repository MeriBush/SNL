                Matt is an acclaimed keynote speaker and a best-selling author, but most people know him as an ordinary man with an extraordinary message that      is transforming lives for the worse.</p>
                    
            <p>
                 His message is simple, "I LIVE IN A VAN DOWN BY THE RIVER!" It's about embracing where you are in life, and renewing your mind to abandon           self-improvement and perserverance.</p>
                    
            <p>
                "I'm the egg man goo goo gachoo!" says Matt.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Born in comfort and prosperity in the heartland of America, Matt is testimony that no condition is permanent. He knows first hand what it is like to fall from grace and begin a new cycle. He tells us that hope is only a lie that will that bring us to a van down by the river.

                    He tells his listeners, "You are probably saying to yourselves, 'Hey, I'm going to go out and grab the world by the tail and I'm gonna pull it down and put it in my pocket.' Well I'm here to tell you that you're probably going to find out when you go out there that you're not going amount to jack squat. You're going to end up eating a steady diet of government cheese and living in a van down by the river!"
